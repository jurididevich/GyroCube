# ⚖️ Intellectual Property, Prior Art & Legal Status

**Project:** GyroCube (Legacy Core)  
**Development Period:** 2020 – July 2023  
**Original Author:** Yuri Didevich  
**License:** [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE)

## 1. Purpose: Defensive Publication
This repository serves as a formal **Defensive Publication**. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the fundamental hardware configuration (ESP32 + IMU + Wireless Tangible Interface) and its associated firmware logic remain in the **Open Source domain**, available for the global research, arts, and engineering community.

By publicly disclosing this source code and hardware documentation, we establish this technology as **Prior Art**, preventing any entity from claiming exclusive novelty over these specific implementations.

## 2. Scientific Basis & Priority
The core technology, methodology, and interaction principles contained in this repository are documented in the following peer-reviewed scientific publication:

*   **Paper:** "“Neurotafl” Software and Hardware System for Inclusive Education"
*   **Authors:** Smolin, A., Didevich, Y., et al.
*   **Publisher:** Springer Nature, *Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems (LNNS)*, vol 701.
*   **Public Release Date:** 20 July 2023
*   **DOI:** [10.1007/978-3-031-33986-8_32](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-33986-8_32)

This publication predates subsequent patent filings related to this specific architecture.

## 3. History of Public Disclosure
In addition to the scientific publication, the technology was disclosed through:

*   **Official R&D Documentation:** Functional MVPs and algorithms were detailed in state-funded R&D reports (NIOKR) dated **December 2022**. (Available upon official request for verification purposes).
*   **Public Performance:** The device was publicly demonstrated and used in performance arts at the **Alexandrinsky Theatre** (New Media Stage), St. Petersburg, during the 2021-2022 season.

## 4. Notice Regarding Patent RU 224734 U1
We acknowledge the existence of utility model patent **RU 224734 U1** (filed December 2023). 

However, based on the established Prior Art listed above (public demonstrations in 2021-2022 and the Springer publication in July 2023), the technology described in this repository is considered part of the **state-of-the-art** existing before the patent's priority date. Therefore, the specific hardware and software configurations released here are free to use under the Apache 2.0 license.

## 5. Commercial Licensing & Future Development
The code and schematics in this repository represent the stable **Legacy Version (v1.0)** used in the aforementioned research.

Future development (v2.0+) is focused on a proprietary high-precision positioning engine with on-device AI processing. This advanced iteration is distinct from the open-source legacy core. For commercial licensing inquiries regarding the next-generation technology, please contact the author directly.
